# Neural-network-optimization-with-evolutionary-algorithm

This is an neural network optimization repo for semantic segmentation tasks, where you can choose starting parameters like type and number of layers, size of feature maps, kernel size, etc. 

You can find list of all these parameters in Main.py file.

All the function implementatoin of evolutionary algorithm is in EA_Optimizer.py file.

train.py consist of the network and other utility functions.
